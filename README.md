Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random ForestWhat is this project?This project develops a highly accurate machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in a public credit card dataset.Problem SolvedCredit card fraud detection is challenging due to extreme data imbalance (very few fraud cases). Our solution minimizes false alarms, ensuring operational efficiency for financial institutions.Key FeaturesFeature Engineering Pipeline: Transforms raw Time and skewed Amount features into relevant inputs for the model.Imbalance Handling: Uses the SMOTE (Oversampling) technique to balance the training data, allowing the model to effectively learn the rare fraud patterns.High Performance: Achieves 86% Precision and 85% Recall on the fraud class, confirmed by an AUC score of 0.973.Deployable Model: The trained Random Forest Classifier is saved as rf_fraud_model.pkl for immediate use in real-time scoring systems.How to Run the ProjectThe entire analysis, modeling, and evaluation are conducted within the provided Jupyter Notebook (hackaton.ipynb).PrerequisitesYou need Python installed. All required packages can be installed via pip:pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib joblib
Option 1: Run Locally (Recommended)Clone the Repository:git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd https://github.com/warrenj01/hackaton-gen-ai-data-analyst
Start Jupyter:jupyter notebook
Open the Notebook: Open the hackaton.ipynb file in your browser.Execute Cells: Run all cells sequentially (e.g., using "Run All" or Shift+Enter) to reproduce the entire data analysis, training, and evaluation pipeline.Option 2: Run on Google ColabUpload Files: Upload the hackaton.ipynb file to your Google Drive. Ensure the dataset (if separate) and the saved model files (if analyzing the results) are also uploaded.Open in Colab: Open the notebook in Google Colab.Install Libraries: Run the first cell(s) to install all required libraries (e.g., !pip install imbalanced-learn).Execute Cells: Run all cells in order to process the data and train the model.
